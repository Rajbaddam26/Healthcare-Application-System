Built with the latest Java technologies, it is designed for extensibility and enterprise-grade reliability.

**Project Summary:**

A robust, secure RESTful application for end-to-end healthcare application management, crafted with:

**Java 17, Spring Boot**

__MySQL__ ‚Äî primary database (H2 for development/testing)

__Spring Security__ (JWT-based authentication & authorization)

__Spring Data JPA/Hibernate__ (for ORM)

__Swagger UI__ (for interactive API documentation/testing)

__Maven__ (builds & dependency management)

__Docker__ (containerized deployment & CI/CD ready)
